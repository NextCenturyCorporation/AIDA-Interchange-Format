# Python Examples Validator

pyValidator.sh creates a directory for Examples.py to write the generated example turtle files to, and validates it.
If all files are valid, the directory will be deleted. If at least one file fails validation, the directory will remain.

* Before running, be sure to mvn install AIF.
* To execute the script, run ./pyValidator.sh
