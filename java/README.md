# Installation

To install the Java code, do `mvn install` from the `java` directory in this repository using Apache Maven.
Repeat this if you pull an updated version of the code. You can run the tests,
which should output the examples, by doing `mvn test`.

# Using the AIF Library

To use the library in Java, include the library generated by the
installation above into your build script or tool.  For gradle, for
example, include the following in the dependencies in your `build.gradle` file:

`dependencies {
    compile 'com.ncc:aida-interchange:1.0.5'
}`

In your code, import classes from the `com.ncc.aif` package.
Then, create a model, add entities, relations, and events to the
model, and then write the model out.

The file `src/test/java/com/ncc/aif/ExamplesAndValidationTests.java`
has a series of examples showing how to add things to the model.  The
`src/test/java/com/ncc/aif/ScalingTest.java` file has examples of how
to write the model out.

# Running the Ontology Resource Generator

To generate the resource variables from a particular ontology file, please refer to
the README located at `src/main/java/com/ncc/aif/ont2javagen/README.md`.

# Additional Information about Individual Ontologies

There is another README located at `src/main/resources/com/ncc/aif/ontologies/README.md` that gives a description about each of the ontology files currently available in AIF.

# Developing

If you need to edit the Java code:
 1. Install IntelliJ IDEA.
 2. "Import Project from Existing Sources"
 3. Choose the `pom.xml` for this repository and accept all defaults.

You should now be ready to go.

# Documentation

To generate the javadoc documentation, navigate to the `java` directory in the AIDA-Interchange-Format project. Run the following command:

```bash
$ javadoc -d build/docs/javadoc/ src/main/java/com/ncc/aif/*.java
```
This script will generate documentation in the form of HTML and place it within the `build/docs/javadoc` folder.
